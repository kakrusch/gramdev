## Overview

a short description of the phenomenon 

- main clause wh-questions in English

## Motivation - why I chose this phenomenon 

What it is, why I chose it, why it is challenging, etc.

- 

## Implementation approach/design


   - new rule for WHQ: wh-words are banned in declaratives and vice verse

   - wh-words as pronouns (only gender and number in specific cases)

   - wh-word fronting via FOCUS and uncertainty paths

   - difference between subject and object wh-word origin:

      - SUBJ: main verb is inflected for case and number (usually 3rd person sg)

      - OBJ: do-support if there is no other aux and main verb is in infinitival form

    
    - extraction from adjuncts

    
    - extraction from PPs (with stranded P)



your implementation approach/design and the reasons for it (including usage of OT marks, restriction operators, testsuire design, etc), and the challenges that remain.
You can have subheadings in this document.
